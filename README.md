## **Introduction** ##

Containment Domains (CDs) is a library-level approach dealing with low-overhead resilient and scalable execution (see [http://lph.ece.utexas.edu/public/CDs](http://lph.ece.utexas.edu/public/CDs)). CDs abandon the prevailing one-size-fits-all approach to resilience and instead embrace the diversity of application needs, resilience mechanisms, and the deep hierarchies expected in exascale hardware and software.  CDs give software a means to express resilience concerns intuitively and concisely.  With CDs, software can preserve and restore state in an optimal way within the storage hierarchy  and can efficiently support uncoordinated recovery.  In addition, CDs allow software to tailor error detection, elision (ignoring some errors), and recovery mechanisms to algorithmic and system needs.

[The documentation about CD API](http://lph.ece.utexas.edu/users/CDAPI/) is available online. 


## **Organization** ##

This repository is Containment Domain (CD) runtime system libraries. This consists of four subdirectories.

1. src : it contains the source code of runtime system.

2. lib : it contains shared objects.

3. doc : it contains the document of runtime system.

4. tools : it contains the tools running with CD runtime system.

5. test : it contains the example codes that is annotated with CD libraries.


## **How to build** ##
1. Include "cds.h" library in your source code.


2. Add ${CD_CFLAGS} and ${CD_LINKFLAGS} when you compile your source code to generate executable. ${CD_LINKFLAGS} will include .so files to enable CD runtime system in your program.


3. See also {CD_ROOT}/test/test_simple_hierarchy/Makefile to get an example for build.
