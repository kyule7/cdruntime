 * Creates all necessary CD runtime components and data structures,

 *
 * There are two variants of this function. The first is a
 * collective operation across all SPMD tasks currently in the

 * the CD in a synchronized manner. The second variant is called
 * locally by a single task and synchronization, as well as
 * broadcasting the handle are up to the programmer. Use of this second
 * variant is discouraged.
 *
 * @return Returns a handle to the root CD; Returns `kOK` if successful, `AlreadyInit` if called more
 * than once, and `kError` if initialization is unsuccessful for
 * some reason.
 *
 * The handle to the root is also registered in some globally

 * CDHandle is a global accessor to the CD object. 
 * CDHandle must be valid regardless of MPI rank or threads
 * That means that once I know CDHandle object, 
 * I can access to the ptr_cd_ anyhow.
 * Sometimes, CDHandle::node_id_.second and CDID::node_id_.second can be different. 
 * (If node_id_.first is different, that means there is something wrong!)
 * That means that CD object was newly given from somewhere,

 * 09.22.2014 Kyushick: The above comment is written long time ago, so may be confusing to understand the current design.
 * All usage of CDs (other than @ref cd_init_funcs and cd_accessor_funcs) is done by
 * utilizing a handle to a particular CD instance within the CD
 * tree. The CDHandle provides an implementation- and
 * location-independent accessor for CD operation.

   *
   * Preserve() preserves data on the first execution of the CD

   * correct and legal preservation methods and have an autotuner
   * select the best one. This is done by setting the appropriate bits
   * in the `preserve_mask` parameter based on the constants defined
   * by PreserveMethodT.
