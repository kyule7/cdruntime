 * Declare the behavior of a region of PGAS/GAS memory within this

 *  relaxed CD and another relaxed CD are logged/tracked.
 *
 * \warning For now, we are using an address to mark the type, but it is
 * quite possible that using actual types and casting is
 * better. Unfortunately types cannot be done through an API
 * interface and require a change to the language. It is not clear
 * how much overhead will be saved through just this API technique
 * and we will explore language changes (see discussion below).
 *
 * In the UPC++ implementation, this API call should not be used, and a cast from 
 * `shared_array` to `privatized_array` (or `shared_var` to `privatized_var`) is
 * preferred. UPC++ implementation should be quite straight-forward
 *
 * \todo Do we want to expose explicit logging functions?
 *
 * Just in UPC runtime, perhaps cram a field that says log
 * vs. unlogged into the pointer representation (steal one
 * bit). That we can perhaps do just in the runtime. A problem is
 * that all pointer operations (e.g., comparisons) need to know
 * about this bit.
 * 
 * If adding to the compiler, then should be done at same point as
 * strict and relaxed are done.
 *
 * There is also a pragma that can be used for changing the default
 * behavior from shared to privatized (assuming that all or at least
 * vast majority of accesses) within a code block are such. This

 * recovery. Log entries may be discarded when both the task that

 * (after descendant CDs complete and "merge"). This can always be
 * guaranteed when the least-common strict ancestor is reached, but
 * may happen sooner. In order to identify the earliest opportunity
 * to discard a log entry, the CD runtime must track producers,
 * which is impractical in general. In the specific and common
 * scenario of "owner computes", however, it is possible to track
 * the producer with low overhead. The SetPGASOwnerWrites() method i
