 * Public header file for configuration-time features.

 * This file should define values for ALL preprocessor symbols required
 * for correctly compiling clients.
 *
 * This means that if a public header file does a 
 * #if CD_FOO
 * then cd_features.h should
 * #define CD_FOO
 * 
 * Unlike config.h, which is ONLY to be used internally during the CD 
 * runtime, this file is intended to be exported to client programs, so that
 * they can test the CD library for the presence of configuration-specific  
 * build flags.
