 * \brief Containment Domains API v0.2 (C++)
 * The purpose of this document is to describe a CD API for
 * programming CD-enabled applications. A complete discussion of the
 * semantics of containment domains is out of scope of this document; the
 * latest version of the semantics is available at
 * <http://lph.ece.utexas.edu/public/CDs>.
 *
 * @section sect_intro Containment Domains Overview
 * 
 * Containment domains (CDs) are a new approach that achieves
 * low-overhead resilient and scalable
 * execution (see http://lph.ece.utexas.edu/public/CDs). CDs abandon the prevailing
 * one-size-fits-all approach to resilience and instead embrace the
 * diversity of application needs, resilience mechanisms, and the deep
 * hierarchies expected in exascale hardware and software. CDs give
 * software a means to express resilience concerns intuitively and
 * concisely. With CDs, software can preserve and restore state in an
 * optimal way within the storage hierarchy and can efficiently
 * support uncoordinated recovery. In addition, CDs allow software to
 * tailor error detection, elision (ignoring some errors), and
 * recovery mechanisms to algorithmic and system needs.

 * \todo Write a more significant introduction and put sections for
 * what are currently modules
 *
 * For now, the documentation is organized around the following
 * "modules", which can also be accessed through the "Modules" tab on
 * the HTML docs.
 *
 * - \ref cd_init_funcs
 * - \ref cd_accessor_funcs
 * - \ref cd_hierarchy
 * - \ref preservation_funcs
 * - \ref detection_recovery
 *   - \ref error_reporting
 *   - \ref internal_recovery 
 *   
 * - \ref cd_error_probability
 * - \ref PGAS_funcs
 * - \ref cd_event_funcs
 * - \ref cd_defs
 *
 * - \ref sec_example_spmv
 * - \ref sec_example_lulesh
