 * 
 * \brief Containment Domains (CD) API v0.2 (C++) is a programming construct 
 * that allows users to express resilience needs in their program.
 * The purpose of this document is to describe a CD API to program CD-enabled applications.
 * Current CD runtime is designed for MPI programs, which also works well with signle node, single thread programs.
 *
 * A complete discussion of the semantics of containment domains is out of scope of this document.
 * The latest version of the semantics is available at
 * <http://lph.ece.utexas.edu/public/CDs>.
 *
 * @section sect_intro Containment Domains Overview
 * 
 * \image html cd_runtime.png "" width=10px
 *
 * Containment Domains (CDs) is a library-level approach dealing with
 * low-overhead resilient and scalable execution (see http://lph.ece.utexas.edu/public/CDs). 
 * CDs abandon the prevailing one-size-fits-all approach to resilience and instead embrace the
 * diversity of application needs, resilience mechanisms, and the deep
 * hierarchies expected in exascale hardware and software. 
 * CDs give software a means to express resilience concerns intuitively and concisely. 
 * With CDs, software can preserve and restore state in an optimal way within the storage hierarchy 
 * and can efficiently support uncoordinated recovery. 
 * In addition, CDs allow software to tailor error detection, elision (ignoring some errors), and
 * recovery mechanisms to algorithmic and system needs.

 * The supported features are descripted as below. Please take a look at it before using CD runtime system for your application.
 * - \ref sec_plans

 *
 * This version of CD runtime system works with MPIPCH. There are some issues with OpenMPI regarding runtime logging, which we do not resolve, yet.
 * So, to use current version of CD runtime system, please use MPICH.

 * the HTML docs.

 * @brief Methods regarding how to create CD hierarchy in application.
 *
 *        This Module is about functions and types to create CD hierarchy in the application.
 * 
 * @defgroup preservation_funcs Preservation/Restoration
 * @brief These modules are regarding how to preserve and restore data in CDs.
 *
 *        The \ref preservation_funcs module contains all preservation/restoration related types and methods.
 * 
 * @defgroup cd_detection Error detection
 * @brief Error detection mechanism supported by CD runtime.

 * @brief Initialization and finalization for CD runtime.
 * 
 * @defgroup cd_accessor_funcs Global CD accessor
 * @brief The \ref cd_accessor_funcs are used to get the current and root.
 *
 *        CD handles if these are not explicitly tracked. These methods are globally accessible without a CDHandle object.
 * 
 * 
 * @defgroup cd_defs CD types/definitions.
 * @brief CD-related type definitions. 
 *
 * The \ref cd_defs module includes general CD-related type
 * definitions that don't fall into other type definitions (\ref
 * error_reporting and \ref preservation_funcs).

 * @brief Interfaces that user need to know.
 * 
 *   @defgroup error_injector Error injection interface
 *   @brief Interface for error injection through CD runtime.
 *
 *    User can inject errors using this error injector interface. 
 *   `ErrorInjector` class is the base class that users will inherit if they want to plug in their own error injector.
 *    This functionality can be turned on/off by setting compile flag, "ENABLE_ERROR_INJECTOR", as 1.
 *    It will be helpful to take a look at how to interact with CDs to inject errors through CD runtime.
