 *
 * \brief Node ID
 * Description on node id
 *
 * In MPI context, one process can be represented by a pair of communicator and MPI rank ID. 
 * But one process can belong to multiple communicators, so one pair of communicator and MPI rank ID do not uniquely represent a single process.
 * 
 * NodeID is a class for representing a task in one CD. Like MPI, one task can be represented by multiple pairs of color and task ID in the color.  
 * Color is a kind of group number or an arbitrary type indicating a group of tasks corresponding to a CD.
 * task_in_a_color means an ID to access a task in that color. 
 * (ex. rank ID of a communicator in MPI context. Communicator corresponds to color_). 
 * size means the number of tasks in that color. With these three information, we can access to any tasks.
