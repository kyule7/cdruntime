NodeID is a class for access to a task in one CD. 
Color is a kind of group number or an arbitrary type indicating a group of tasks corresponding to a CD.
task_in_a_color means an ID to access a task in that color. 
(ex. rank ID of a communicator in MPI context. Communicator corresponds to color_). 
size means the number of tasks in that color. With these three information, we can access to any tasks.
