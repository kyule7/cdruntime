CDID is for naming uniquely one of the CDs. 
So, it is a logical ID of our CD semantic which is independent on any other execution environment.
We can represent a CD with level and rank_in_a_level in the CD tree graph. 
So, these two numbers are needed, but they are not sufficient. 
One CD may create non-collectively, and just create one child CD, 
it does not reflect this new CD with this level and rank_in_level. 
To differentiate it, we need object_id which is unique ID in local address space. 
This local address spaceâ€™s ID can be global with the combination of level+rank_in_a_level.
But it is still not sufficient, because we are reusing CD object by Begin/Complete. 
So in this case, we need sequential_id which is corresponding to the version number of a CD object.
We may need domain_id which is about physical location of the CDs, 
but we do not work on it, so do not use this for now.
it does not contain any information to access one of the processes (mpi ranks) which are belonging to one CD. 
So, we need this information to access a CD. 
Color is a kind of group number or an arbitrary type indicating a group of tasks corresponding to a CD.
task_in_a_color means an ID to access a task in that color. 
(ex. rank ID of a communicator in MPI context. Communicator corresponds to color_). 
size means the number of tasks in that color. With these three information, we can access to any tasks.

Q. # of sibing CDs should be here?
