 *
 * \brief CD ID
 *
 * Description on node id
 * CDID is for naming uniquely one of the CDs. 
 * So, it is a logical ID of our CD semantic which is independent on any other execution environment.
 * We can represent a CD with level and rank_in_a_level in the CD tree graph. 
 * So, these two numbers are needed, but they are not sufficient. 
 * One CD may create non-collectively, and just create one child CD, 
 * it does not reflect this new CD with this level and rank_in_level. 
 * To differentiate it, we need object_id which is unique ID in local address space. 
 * This local address spaceâ€™s ID can be global with the combination of level+rank_in_a_level.
 * But it is still not sufficient, because we are reusing CD object by Begin/Complete. 
 * So in this case, we need sequential_id which is corresponding to the version number of a CD object.
 * We may need domain_id which is about physical location of the CDs, 
 * but we do not work on it, so do not use this for now.
 * it does not contain any information to access one of the processes (mpi ranks) which are belonging to one CD. 
 * So, we need this information to access a CD. 
 * Color is a kind of group number or an arbitrary type indicating a group of tasks corresponding to a CD.
 * task_in_a_color means an ID to access a task in that color. 
 * (ex. rank ID of a communicator in MPI context. Communicator corresponds to color_). 
 * size means the number of tasks in that color. With these three information, we can access to any tasks.
 * 
 * Q. # of sibing CDs should be here?

/**@class CDID
 * @brief A type to uniquely identify a task in CD hierarchy.
 *
 * A CD name consists of its level in the CD tree (root=0), and the
 * its ID, or sequence number, within that level. 
 * 
 * \note Alternatives:
 * - The alternative of simply a unique name misses the idea of
 * levels in the tree; the idea of hierarchy is central to CDs so
 * this is a bad alternative.
 * - The alternative of naming a CD by its entire "branch" leads
 * to requiring the name to be parsed to identify the level; the
 * level is typically the most crucial information so this seems
 * unduly complex. 
 * - A third alternative is to store the branch information as a
 * std::vector, so the vector's length is the level. However, this
 * means the name is rather long.
