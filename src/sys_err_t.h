 * \brief Type for specifying system errors and failure names
 *
 * This type represents the interface between the user and the
 * system with respect to errors and failures. The intent is for
 * these error/failure names to be fairly comprehensive with respect
 * to system-based issues, while still providing general/abstract
 * enough names to be useful to the application programmer. The use
 * categories/names are meant to capture recovery strategies that
 * might be different based on the error/failure and be
 * comprehensive in that regard. The
 * DeclareErrName() method may be used to create a
 * programmer-defined error that may be associated with a
 * programmer-provided detection method.
 *
 * We considered doing
 * an extensible class hierarchy like GVR, but ended up with a
 * hybrid type system. There are predefined bit vector constants
 * for error/failure names and machine location names. These may be
 * extended by application programmers for specialized
 * detectors. These types are meant to capture abstract general
 * classes of errors that may be treated differently by recovery
 * functions and therefore benefit from easy-to-access and
 * well-defined names. Additional error/failure-specific
 * information will be represented by the SysErrInfo interface class
 * hierarchy, which may be extended by the programmer at compiler
 * time. Thus, each error/failure is a combination of 
 * SysErrNameT, SysErrLocT, and SysErrInfo.
