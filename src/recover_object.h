 * programer to create custom Recover routines. The idea is that for
 * each CD, each error type+location may be bound to a specialized
 * recovery routine, which is expressed through a Recover object. The
 * Recover object inherits the default RecoverObject and extends or
 * replaces the default restore+reexecute recovery method.
 *
 * \todo Write some example for custom recovery (see GVR
 * interpolation example, although they do it between versions).
